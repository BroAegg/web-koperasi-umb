## 🔄 CURRENT STEP: Manual Testing Required

**YOU NEED TO DO THIS NOW**:

### 1. Open Browser
- Go to: http://localhost:3000/login

### 2. Open Console (F12)
- Press F12
- Click "Console" tab

### 3. Clear Storage
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
```

### 4. Hard Refresh
- Press: Ctrl + Shift + R

### 5. Test Super Admin Login
```
Email: superadmin@umb.ac.id
Password: Password123!
```

**Watch Console For**:
```
[Dashboard] useEffect triggered
[Dashboard] authLoading: false
[Dashboard] user: {...}
[Dashboard] user role: SUPER_ADMIN
[Dashboard] Fetching SUPER_ADMIN dashboard
[Dashboard] Super admin stats response: {...}
```

### 6. Screenshot Console
- If you see errors (RED text), screenshot it
- If dashboard is BLANK, screenshot console anyway
- Share screenshots so I can analyze

## 🐛 WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

### If Console Shows:
```
❌ ERROR: Failed to fetch
```
→ **Problem**: API endpoint issue

### If Console Shows:
```
❌ TypeError: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined
```
→ **Problem**: Data structure mismatch

### If Console Shows:
```
[Dashboard] authLoading: true
[Dashboard] authLoading: true
(stuck in loop)
```
→ **Problem**: useAuth hook issue

### If Console is Clean But Blank:
```
(no errors, but nothing renders)
```
→ **Problem**: React component logic issue

## 💡 WHY THIS APPROACH

1. **Logging Already Added** ✅
   - Both dashboard files have comprehensive console.log
   - We don't need to add more logs
   - We just need to READ what they tell us

2. **Environment Already Fixed** ✅
   - JWT_SECRET synchronized
   - Database recreated
   - No env issues possible

3. **Code Looks Good** ✅
   - API routes are correct
   - Component logic is sound
   - No obvious errors

4. **Need Real-World Test**
   - Console will show EXACT problem
   - We fix based on FACTS, not guesses
   - Screenshot = evidence

## ⏱️ TIME ESTIMATE

- **Your Testing**: 5-10 minutes (all 3 roles)
- **Screenshot & Report**: 2 minutes
- **My Analysis**: 5-10 minutes (if issue found)
- **Fix & Retest**: 10-20 minutes

**Total**: ~30-40 minutes to complete all dashboard fixes

## 🎯 GOAL

By end of today (19 Oktober):
- ✅ All 3 dashboards rendering
